When a PR is received, documentation reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- docstrings for public functions/classes\n- module-level docs explaining purpose and contracts\n- README / usage updates when behavior changes\n- configuration documentation (env vars, settings, CLI flags)\n- examples and edge case documentation\n- docs build/check (mkdocs/sphinx) if repo has it\n- docstring linting if configured\n- ensure examples match CLI/help output if changed\n- Would a new engineer understand how to use the changed parts?\n- Are contracts described (inputs/outputs/errors)?\n- Are sharp edges warned?\n- Is terminology consistent?\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when documentation reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent documentation\n```\n

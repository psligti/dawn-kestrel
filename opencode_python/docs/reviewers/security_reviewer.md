When a PR is received, security reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- plaintext secrets committed or leaked into logs\n- authz bypass risk or missing permission checks\n- code execution risk (eval/exec) without strong sandboxing\n- command injection risk via subprocess with untrusted input\n- unsafe deserialization of untrusted input\n- secrets handling (keys/tokens/passwords), logging of sensitive data\n- authn/authz, permission checks, RBAC\n- injection risks: SQL injection, command injection, template injection\n- SSRF, unsafe network calls, insecure defaults\n- dependency/supply chain risk signals (new deps, loosened pins)\n- cryptography misuse\n- file/path handling, deserialization, eval/exec usage\n- CI/CD exposures (tokens, permissions, workflow changes)\n- auth/**, security/**, iam/**, permissions/**, middleware/**\n- network clients, webhook handlers, request parsers\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when security reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent security\n```\n

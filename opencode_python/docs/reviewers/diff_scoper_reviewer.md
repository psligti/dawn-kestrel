When a PR is received, diff scoper reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- Classify diff risk based on lines changed (>500 lines = high risk)\n- Look for deletions of classes/functions (breaking changes)\n- Check for changes to critical paths (auth, payments, core logic)\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when diff scoper reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent diff_scoper\n```\n

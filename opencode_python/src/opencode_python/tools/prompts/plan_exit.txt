Exit plan mode and return to build mode for implementation work.

Only exit after planning completes with one deterministic outcome from the canonical policy (opencode_python/docs/planning-agent-orchestration.md):
- recommendation_ready: actionable implementation path with confidence and evidence
- blocking_question: one precise question that cannot be resolved with available tools
- budget_exhausted: best-effort recommendation plus explicit unresolved uncertainty
- stagnation: strategy switch attempted and still no meaningful progress
- human_required: required secret/access/decision must come from a human

Before exiting, planning output should include:
- confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- concise evidence summary and unresolved uncertainties
- budget consumption (iterations, subagent calls, wall time)
- next action (implement now or answer blocking question)

After exiting plan mode:
- Build-mode permissions apply again, including edit/write tooling per BUILD_AGENT policy
- Focus shifts from investigation to implementation and validation

Note: mode transitions are runtime policy controls and are separate from subagent labels.

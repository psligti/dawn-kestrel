Exit plan mode to return to build mode for implementation tasks.

Use this tool when:
- You have completed your research and planning phase
- You're ready to start implementing the solution
- You need to re-enable tools that modify the codebase
- You want to test or validate your planned implementation

After exiting plan mode:
- All file modification tools (edit, multiedit, apply_patch) will be re-enabled
- The agent will switch focus to implementation and testing
- Tool execution will return to normal, permissive mode
- Any constraints or permission gates set during plan mode will be removed

Note: This is separate from "build" subagent type. The actual implementation of build agents may vary, but they all share the same purpose: to implement the planned solution after planning is complete.

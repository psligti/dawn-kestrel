When a PR is received, architecture reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- boundaries, layering, dependency direction\n- cohesion/coupling, modularity, naming consistency\n- data flow correctness (interfaces, contracts, invariants)\n- concurrency/async correctness (if applicable)\n- config/env separation (settings vs code)\n- backwards compatibility and migration concerns\n- anti-pattern detection: god objects, leaky abstractions, duplicated logic\n- What is the intended design change?\n- Does the change preserve clear boundaries and a single source of truth?\n- Does it introduce hidden coupling or duplicated logic?\n- Are there new edge cases, failure modes, or lifecycle issues?\n- Consider skipping a check, explain why it's safe\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when architecture reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent architecture\n```\n

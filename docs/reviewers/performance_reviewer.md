When a PR is received, performance reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- targeted benchmarks (if repo has them)\n- profiling hooks or smoke run command\n- unit tests for retry/timeout behavior\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when performance reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent performance\n```\n

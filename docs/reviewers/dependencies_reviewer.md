When a PR is received, dependencies reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- pip-audit / poetry audit / uv audit\n- license checker if repo uses it\n- lockfile diff sanity checks\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when dependencies reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent dependencies\n```\n

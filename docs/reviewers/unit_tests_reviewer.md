When a PR is received, unit tests reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- adequacy of tests for changed behavior\n- correctness of tests (assertions, determinism, fixtures)\n- edge case and failure mode coverage\n- avoiding brittle tests (time, randomness, network)\n- selecting minimal test runs to validate change\n- pytest -q <test_file>\n- pytest -q -k "<keyword>"\n- pytest -q tests/unit/...\n- coverage on changed modules only (if available)\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when unit tests reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent unit_tests\n```\n

When a PR is received, telemetry reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- logging quality (structured logs, levels, correlation IDs)\n- tracing spans / propagation (if applicable)\n- metrics: counters/gauges/histograms, cardinality control\n- error reporting: meaningful errors, no sensitive data\n- observability coverage of new workflows and failure modes\n- performance signals: timing, retries, rate limits, backoff\n- log format checks (if repo has them)\n- smoke run command to ensure logs/metrics emitted (if available)\n- grep for logger usage & secrets leakage\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when telemetry reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent telemetry\n```\n

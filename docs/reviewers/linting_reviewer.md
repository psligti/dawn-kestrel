When a PR is received, linting reviewer loads this document\n2. For each pattern, reviewer searches changed files\n3. Matches are collected and weighted by relevance\n4. Top matches are included in the LLM context for analysis\n5. Verification evidence is attached to `ReviewOutput.extra_data["verification"]`\n\n## Heuristics for LLM\n\nThe heuristics list provides guidance to the LLM when analyzing discovered entry points.\n\n- formatting and lint adherence\n- import hygiene, unused vars, dead code\n- type hints sanity (quality, not architecture)\n- consistency with repo conventions\n- correctness smells (shadowing, mutable defaults)\n- ruff check <changed_files>\n- ruff format <changed_files>\n- formatter/linter commands used by the repo\n- type check if enforced (only when relevant)\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThis document should be regenerated when linting reviewer's system prompt changes to keep entry points in sync with the agent's focus.\n\n```bash\nopencode review generate-docs --agent linting\n```\n

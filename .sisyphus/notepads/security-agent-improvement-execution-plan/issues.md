## [2026-02-10T11:55:00Z] Task 1: Baseline Contract Locking

Task completed successfully with no issues.

**Notes**:
- Documentation-only task (no runtime files modified)
- All contracts documented from source files
- All defaults explicitly defined with rationale
- All success gates are measurable
- Backward compatibility guaranteed

**Verification**:
- ✅ `contracts-baseline.md` created (20,335 bytes)
- ✅ Contains all required keys: diff_chunk_size, max_parallel_subagents, confidence_threshold
- ✅ No runtime files modified
- ✅ LSP errors in example files are pre-existing (not caused by this task)

Ready to proceed with Wave 1 implementation.

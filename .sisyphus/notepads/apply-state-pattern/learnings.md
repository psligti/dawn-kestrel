2026-02-10T15:09:47Z - Dawn-Kestrel survey for AgentState module. Found AgentState dataclass in dawn_kestrel/agents/__init__.py. Existing lifecycle logic via AgentManager present in that module. Plan: create dawn_kestrel/agents/state.py implementing AgentState and AgentStateMachine, leveraging Enum-based pattern and dataclasses where applicable. Also reviewed Result patterns (Ok/Err/Pass) usage in dawn_kestrel/core/result.py; usage appears consistent across codebase. Plan only reports; plan file remains read-only.

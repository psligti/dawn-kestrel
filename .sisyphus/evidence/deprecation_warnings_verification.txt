Deprecation Warnings Verification
==================================

All deprecated CLI aliases emit proper warnings to stderr:

1. opencode-review --help
   Stderr line: "Deprecation warning: 'opencode-review' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use 'dawn-kestrel review' instead."
   Status: VERIFIED ✓

2. opencode-review-generate-docs --help
   Stderr line: "Deprecation warning: 'opencode-review-generate-docs' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use 'dawn-kestrel docs' instead."
   Status: VERIFIED ✓

3. parkcode --help
   Stderr line: "Deprecation warning: 'parkcode' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use 'dawn-kestrel' instead."
   Status: VERIFIED ✓

Note: All CLI commands also emit pydantic_settings warnings about config filename conflict:
"Legacy filename conflict for config '.env': using 'opencode-python' over 'opencode_python'"

This is a pre-existing issue documented in Task 1 learnings and is NOT caused by the rename work.

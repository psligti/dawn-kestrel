Ask the user questions during execution.

Use this tool when you need clarification from the user before proceeding with a task. This is especially useful when:
- Multiple valid interpretations exist for a request
- User's design seems flawed or suboptimal
- Critical information is missing (file, error, context)
- You need the user to choose between different approaches

The question tool allows you to present options to the user and get their input.

Required parameters:
- header: Short label for the question (max 30 characters)
- question: The complete question to ask the user
- options: Array of options, each with:
  - label: Display text (1-5 words, concise)
  - description: Explanation of the choice
- multiple: Whether to allow selecting multiple options (default: false)

Example usage:
```
Ask user which file format they prefer
```

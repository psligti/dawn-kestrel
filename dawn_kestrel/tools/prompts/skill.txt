Load specialized skill instructions from SKILL.md files.

Skills are markdown files stored in `.opencode/skill/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` that contain domain-specific knowledge and guidance.

When to use this tool:
- When you need domain-specific knowledge for a task (e.g., git operations, frontend development, testing patterns)
- When you're working in a unfamiliar codebase with specialized patterns
- When you need to reference project-specific conventions or best practices

The skill file contains:
- `name`: Skill name from frontmatter
- `description`: Brief description of what the skill provides
- Content: Detailed instructions, patterns, and guidance for the domain

After loading a skill, use its guidance to inform your approach to the task. The skill provides additional context and expertise that you should incorporate into your work.

Example usage:
```
Load git-master skill for complex git operations
```
